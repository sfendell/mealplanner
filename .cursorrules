# Cursor Rules for MealPrep Project

## File Watchers
When meals.txt is saved, automatically alphabetize it:

```bash
# Run alphabetization script when meals.txt is saved
if [[ $1" == "meals.txt" ]]; then
    echo🔄Auto-alphabetizing meals.txt..."
    python3 alphabetize_meals.py
    if  $? -eq0 then
        echo✅Meals alphabetized successfully! else
        echo "❌ Failed to alphabetize meals"
    fi
fi
```

## Project Guidelines
- Always alphabetize meals.txt after editing
- Keep ingredients organized (quantified first, then unquantified)
- Maintain proper spacing between meals
